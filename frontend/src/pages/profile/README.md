- **Password Visibility**: Toggle password visibility for better user experience
- **Confirmation**: Password confirmation to prevent typos

### 3. User Preferences
- **Email Notifications**: Toggle for email notification preferences
- **Push Notifications**: Toggle for push notification preferences

- **Image Management**: Save and remove functionality for uploaded images

### 5. Account Status
- **Status Indicators**: Visual status chips for account health
- **Email Verification**: Shows email verification status
- **Two-Factor Authentication**: Placeholder for 2FA status

### 6. User Statistics
- **Activity Overview**: Comprehensive user activity dashboard
- **Task Statistics**: Total tasks, completed tasks, and completion rate
- **Project Statistics**: Number of projects user is involved in
- **Time Tracking**: Total hours logged (placeholder for future implementation)
- **Progress Visualization**: Visual progress bars and charts

## Technical Implementation

### Frontend Components

#### ProfilePage.tsx
Main profile page component that orchestrates all profile functionality:
- State management for forms and UI interactions
- API integration for profile updates
- Error handling and success notifications
- Responsive design with Material-UI components

#### UserStats.tsx
Statistics component displaying user activity and performance metrics:
- Activity overview cards
- Progress indicators
- Recent activity placeholder
- Responsive grid layout

### Backend Integration

#### API Endpoints
- `PUT /auth/profile` - Update user profile information
- `PUT /auth/password` - Change user password
- `GET /auth/me` - Get current user profile

#### Redux State Management
- `updateProfile` - Async thunk for profile updates
- `changePassword` - Async thunk for password changes
- Loading states and error handling
- Real-time state updates

### Data Flow

1. **Profile Loading**: User data is loaded from Redux store on component mount
2. **Form Initialization**: Form fields are populated with current user data
3. **User Interactions**: Users can toggle edit modes and modify information
4. **Validation**: Client-side validation ensures data integrity
5. **API Calls**: Redux thunks handle API communication
6. **State Updates**: Successful operations update Redux store
7. **UI Feedback**: Loading states and success/error messages provide user feedback

## User Experience Features

### Accessibility
- Proper ARIA labels for screen readers
- Keyboard navigation support
- High contrast color schemes
- Focus management for form interactions

### Responsive Design
- Mobile-first approach
- Adaptive layouts for different screen sizes
- Touch-friendly interface elements
- Optimized for tablet and desktop use

### Error Handling
- Comprehensive error messages
- Form validation feedback
- Network error recovery
- Graceful degradation

### Loading States
- Skeleton loading for initial data fetch
- Button loading states during operations
- Progress indicators for long-running tasks
- Optimistic UI updates

## Security Considerations

### Password Security
- Current password verification before changes
- Minimum password strength requirements
- Secure password transmission
- Password visibility controls

### Data Protection
- Input sanitization and validation
- Secure API communication
- Token-based authentication
- Session management

### Privacy
- User consent for data collection
- Transparent data usage
- User control over preferences
- Data retention policies

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
1. **Avatar Upload**: Complete file upload implementation with backend storage
2. **Two-Factor Authentication**: 2FA setup and management
3. **Activity History**: Detailed user activity timeline
4. **Export Data**: User data export functionality
5. **Account Deletion**: Account deactivation and deletion options

### Technical Improvements
1. **Image Optimization**: Automatic image compression and resizing
2. **Caching**: Implement caching for user statistics
3. **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket integration for live updates
4. **Offline Support**: Service worker for offline functionality
5. **Performance**: Lazy loading and code splitting
